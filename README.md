**Here are five bullet point my Supercars toy website project:**

* Website design: Create a visually appealing website with a distinct logo and place the website name in the navbar for easy navigation and brand recognition.

* All Toys page: Implement a page where all car toy data is displayed, allowing users to explore and browse through the available toys.

* My Toys page: Develop a personalized section where users can view their own car toy data, providing them with a customized experience and easy access to their collection.

* CRUD operations with MongoDB: Integrate MongoDB database to enable Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing the toy data effectively.

* Login & Registration systems with Firebase: Implement a secure login and registration system using Firebase authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and access their personalized data. Utilize private routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain pages. Additionally, create a 404 error page to handle any invalid or non-existent URLs gracefully.
